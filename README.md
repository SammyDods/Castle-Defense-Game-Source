# Grade-11-Castle-Game-Source
Source code of a castle defense game I made using unity in grade 11.

The biggest hurdle for this project was probally learning how to use unity. I probally didn't even learn how to use it optimally since I never really fully followed along with any tutorials but learned bits and elements from various tutorials to make what I wanted to make.

I learned a lot about classes in this project. I used class abstraction, polymorphism and inheritence to create my parent building class and subsequent farm/house/archer-tower buildings. I learned about virtual classes and static classes and I figured out how to use collider 2d to detect when archer arrows hit goblins. 

I used some maths to create a grid system but it's pretty inconsistent and if I ever came back to this project it would be the first thing I'd redo.
